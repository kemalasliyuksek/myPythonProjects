                        Listing prime numbers up to the value we enter.

              A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that
            is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1
            that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because
            the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
            However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are
            smaller than 4.
